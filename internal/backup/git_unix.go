// returned function must be called once the command has finished. After a
// cancel it replaces the pending delayed SIGKILL with an immediate one, so
// a child that ignored SIGTERM cannot outlive git, and so the kill can
// never fire later against a process group that has since been given the
// same id. If the group is already gone the command finished on its own,
